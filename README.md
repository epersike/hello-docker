# Product Name
> Project for study porpouse only.

Feel free to fork and do some study yourself.

## Installation

Get started with Docker - [Click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Usage example

build.sh - Builds the application's containers
run.sh - Runs the containers
compose.sh - Runs the containers using the docker-compose file.

## Notes

    * docker-compose.dev.yml sets volume to ./src - This means that every time you make some changes in src/app.py you don't need to rebuild and recreate the image, just restart the container and your new code will be running.
